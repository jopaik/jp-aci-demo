Due to the high cost of having Cisco ACI starter fabric $250k+ and Cisco ACI Simulator $10k+(not including the hardware cost)
Cisco DevNet has generously provided Cisco ACI on the Internet for development purposes.

I have created Ansible playbooks to create, get, and remove configurations to execute

Thanks to Cisco DevNet for keeping the cloud ACI environment available.
